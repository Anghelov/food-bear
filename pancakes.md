INGREDIENTS

1 cup of flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon caster sugar
pinch of salt
zest of 2 oranges
2 eggs, separated
125mls milk
Â½ cup ricotta
butter, for frying
fresh figs
runny honey
Greek yoghurt and pomegranate to serve

METHOD
Sieve the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Add the orange zest, egg yolks and milk and mix until smooth. Fold through the ricotta, make sure it is evenly mixed through. 

In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add a spoonful of egg whites to the pancake batter, mix until batter has softened and then fold through remaining egg whites. 

In a skillet or non-stick fry pan, melt a knob of butter over a medium heat. Place a large spoonful of batter into the pan and fry for approximately 2 minutes on each side. Pancakes are ready to be flipped when bubbles appear in the centre of the pancake and the edges are beginning to set.

Serve with wedges of fresh figs, Greek yoghurt, runny honey and pomegranate seeds. These pancakes also work fantastically with poached rhubarb or tamarillos.
